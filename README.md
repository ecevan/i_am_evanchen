# iAmEvanChen
<hr>
This website serves as my platform for introducing myself and exploring new job opportunities. I am Evan Chen, and I invite you to engage in a conversation with me through the chatbox if you are interested in my resume or would like to learn more about me personally.

Utilizing frontend technologies such as Bootstrap, Anime.js, and other essential web development tools, I have crafted an engaging user experience. On the backend, Python and ChatGPT power a virtual version of myself, enabling dynamic and interactive conversations with visitors.

Inspired by ChatGPT and the innovative work of Julian Garnier at https://juliangarnier.com/, this project combines the best elements of both to create a unique and immersive experience.
